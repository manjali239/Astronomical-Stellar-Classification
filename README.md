Stellar Classification Challenge
Project Overview
Objective:
Develop a robust machine learning model to classify stars into different types based on their astronomical characteristics. The model aims to predict the star type from a set of features, including temperature, luminosity, radius, and absolute magnitude.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains information about stars, including the following features:

Temperature (K)
Luminosity (L/Lo)
Radius (R/Ro)
Absolute Magnitude (Mv)
Star Type: The target variable with six possible classesâ€”Brown Dwarf, Red Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence, Supergiant, Hypergiant.
Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Loading and Inspecting the Dataset:

The dataset was loaded, and an initial inspection was conducted to understand the structure and identify any missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Correlation heatmaps and scatter matrix plots were created to analyze relationships between features.
Feature distribution and class distribution were explored to gain further insights.
Data Preparation:

Handling of missing values (if any).
Normalization of features to bring them onto a common scale.
Splitting of the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model Development
Several classification algorithms were implemented and trained to predict the star type:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
Decision Tree
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)
Evaluation
The performance of each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report: Including Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
Visualization and Interpretation
Decision Tree Visualization:

The decision tree model was visualized to understand the decision boundaries and the importance of different features.
LDA Components:

LDA components were visualized to explore how well the model separates different classes.
Scatter Plots and Other Visualizations:

Various scatter plots and visualizations were created to present the results and insights from the models.
Results
Model Comparison:

After comparing the accuracy scores of various models, the Decision Tree model was found to be the most accurate, with an accuracy of 99% on the test set.
KNN and LDA models also performed well, with accuracy scores close to the Decision Tree model.
The small size of the dataset contributed to the high accuracy of the models.
Decision Tree Details:

The Decision Tree had a maximum depth of 5 nodes and accurately classified stars into the six types with high precision.
